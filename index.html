		<p>Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language. It is an open source language, released under a GPL-compatible license. Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization, holds the copyright of Python</p>
	<p>Guido Van Rossum conceived Python in the late 1980s. It was released in 1991 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. He named this language after a popular comedy show called 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' (and not after Python-the snake).</p>
	<p>In the last few years, its popularity has increased immensely. According to stackoverflow.com's recent survey, Python is in the top ten Most Popular Technologies in 2018.</p>
	<h1>Python Version History: </h1>
	<p> Currently, PSF supports two versions, Python 2.x & Python 3.x. Python 2.0 was released in October 2000 and includes a large number of features. PSF continues to support version Python 2 because a large body of existing code could not be forward ported to Python 3. So, they will support Python 2 until 2020. Python 3.0 was released on December 3rd, 2008. It was designed to rectify certain flaws in earlier version. This version is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. However, many of its major features have since been back-ported to the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include 2 to 3 utilities to facilitate the automation of translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>

		<h1>Python Features:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>	Python is an interpreter-based language, which allows execution of one instruction at a time.</li>
			<li>	Extensive basic data types are supported e.g. numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.</li>
			<li>	Variables can be strongly typed as well as dynamic typed.</li>
			<li>	Supports object-oriented programming concepts such as class, inheritance, objects, module, namespace etc.</li>
			<li>	Cleaner exception handling support.</li>
			<li>Supports automatic memory management.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Python Advantages</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>	Python provides enhanced readability. For that purpose, uniform indents are used to delimit blocks of statements instead of curly brackets, like in many languages such as C, C++ and Java.</li>
			<li>	Python is free and distributed as open-source software. A large programming community is actively involved in the development and support of Python libraries for various applications such as web frameworks, mathematical computing and data science.</li>
			<li>	Python is a cross-platform language. It works equally on different OS platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac OSX etc. Hence Python applications can be easily ported across OS platforms.</li>
			<li>	Python supports multiple programming paradigms including imperative, procedural, object-oriented and functional programming styles.</li>
			<li>	Python is an extensible language. Additional functionality (other than what is provided in the core language) can be made available through modules and packages written in other languages (C, C++, Java etc)</li>
			<li>	A standard DB-API for database connectivity has been defined in Python. It can be enabled using any data source (Oracle, MySQL, SQLite etc.) as a backend to the Python program for storage, retrieval and processing of data.</li>
			<li>	Standard distribution of Python contains the Tkinter GUI toolkit, which is the implementation of popular GUI library called Tcl/Tk. An attractive GUI can be constructed using Tkinter. Many other GUI libraries like Qt, GTK, WxWidgets etc. are also ported to Python.</li>
		<li>Python can be integrated with other popular programming technologies like C, C++, Java, ActiveX and CORBA.</li>
